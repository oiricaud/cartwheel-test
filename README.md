# Cartwheel Test

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.4.5.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

# Front End Intern Exam
As we’re a time tracking automation company, our front end test is a pretty simple one.

## Requirements:
Create an Angular 4 application, that will present a user with a screen that lets them type in a
task, and start a timer. Every time the timer is stopped, add that task to a list. This list should
persist, so that upon reloading the page, the list will re-populate with the previous tasks. The list
should have the following information:

  - Task Name
  - Task Start Time
  - Task End Time
  - Task Duration

### Technical Requirements:

  - Make sure the code runs and works. We will be testing it in node 6
  - This app should use, and run with the Angular CLI
  -  We’re looking for this application to be modern​ ​and​ ​beautiful
  - The goal of this is to create something as professional as possible to show off
your HTML, and CSS skills
 - Create at least 1 unit and e2e test
 - This should use Typescript
 -  We don’t expect expert-level Typescript, but as Typescript is the first-class
language of Angular, that’s what it should use.

Bonus points if this persists to a service like firebase
Extra bonus points if you integrate ngrx,​ to manage the application state
